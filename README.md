This Python code constitutes the practical part for the Graph Representation Learning Mini Project "Mitigating Oversmoothing through Structured Graph
Randomization" (Michaelmas Term 2024).
The ".ipynb" file may be excuted by simply running every cell. The four code cells under "Cora Norm" are the most time intensive.
The code contains some elements of the Graph Representation Learning module's practicals as well as some AI assistance (where indicated).
